    <br>
    She is a special girl, who holds a special place in my heart. She is the star of my galaxy, and the sun of my life.<br>
    I love her, a lot. and I cannot even express how much she means to me.<br>
    she is truly the best girl I have met till now, and i do not want to lose her..<br>
    if I could, I would give the world to my Carolina. She cheers me up every time i feel down,<br>
    she holds me every time I fall down.<br>
    i know, we are young. but still, this girl makes me feel like i am the ruler of a kingdom.<br>
